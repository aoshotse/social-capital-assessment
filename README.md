# Social Capital Assessment Tool

This tool helps individuals map and understand the social capital within their networks by examining relationships across multiple domains of life. By identifying who they know, how strong and positive those ties are, and how different contacts connect to one another, students can visualize and measure the structure of their personal or professional networks. Such insights help them better understand opportunities for leveraging resources, gaining influence, and strengthening the bonds that drive career and organizational success.

## What Does the App Do?

- **Contact Input:** Users enter contacts from various life domains (e.g., Family/Friends, Work/Professional, Education/Alumni, Community/Volunteering, Hobbies/Recreational Groups).
- **Tie Characteristics:** Each contact is tagged with tie strength (how close/frequent the interaction) and valence (positive, neutral, or negative tone).
- **Connections:** Users specify which contacts know each other, building a network graph.
- **Metrics & Insights:** The app calculates key network measures (size, density, domain composition, valence distribution) and identifies central and peripheral individuals, along with a measure of connectivity and closure.
- **Visualization:** The final output is an interactive network graph and a set of reflection questions to help students interpret their network.

## Who Is This For?

- **Students:** Gain hands-on experience applying concepts of social capital and network analysis to their own relationships. This reflection can guide career planning, professional development, and strategic networking decisions.
- **Instructors/Professors:** Use this tool as part of an MBA or organizational behavior course to help learners apply theoretical concepts in a practical setting.
- **Researchers/Practitioners:** Anyone interested in understanding how their social capital might influence their work, leadership opportunities, or organizational changes.
